Description: The EnrichmentBrowser package implements essential functionality 
    for the enrichment analysis of gene expression data. The analysis combines 
    the advantages of set-based and network-based enrichment analysis in order 
    to derive high-confidence gene sets and biological pathways that are 
    differentially regulated in the expression data under investigation. 
    Besides, the package facilitates the visualization and exploration of such 
    sets and pathways.
