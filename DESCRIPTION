Description: The EnrichmentBrowser package implements essential
        functionality for the enrichment analysis of gene expression
        data. The analysis combines the advantages of set-based and
        network-based enrichment analysis in order to derive
        high-confidence gene sets and biological pathways that are
        differentially regulated in the expression data under
        investigation. In addition, the package facilitates the
        visualization and exploration of such sets and pathways.
